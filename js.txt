for loop: This loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat a block of code. You specify the number of times the loop should run upfront.

for/in loop: This loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. It's like a specialized version of the for loop specifically designed for objects.

for/of loop: This loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object like an array. It's great for when you want to work directly with the values rather than their indices.

while loop: This loop will keep running a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's useful when you don't know beforehand how many times the loop needs to run.

do/while loop: This loop is similar to a while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code inside the loop will execute at least once, even if the condition is initially false. After the first execution, it behaves like a regular while loop.
